    let age1 = 100;
    let age2 = age1;
    console.log(age1, age2);
    age1 = 200;
    console.log(age1, age2);

    let name = "Zac";
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2);
    name = "Baston"
    console.log(name, name2);
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = "Zac";
    // array updates always flow back to the original array
    console.log(players, team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: "Zac",
      age: 32
    }
    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 });
    console.log(captain2, person);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const captain3 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(captain));
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
